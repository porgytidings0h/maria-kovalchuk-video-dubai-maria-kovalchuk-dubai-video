Ten days later, she was discovered on the side of a road, bloodied and with several horrific injuries, including a broken spine and limbs. 
According to a New York Post report, the 20-year-old had told her friends that she was attending a hotel party while in Dubai, which is allegedly thought to be a ‘sex party’.

Her family grew worried when she missed her flight to Thailand two days later and couldn't be contacted for over a week after that.

She was found on the side of a road ten days after initially going missing, in a bloodied condition and with several horrific injuries, including a broken spine and limbs. The report added that Kovalchuk wasn't able to speak when found in such a condition.
It was also reported that when found, she was unable to speak.

After being rushed to a hospital, Kovalchuk underwent four different surgeries to save her life.

here are now fears mounting that she was the victim of a sinister sex slave plot in Dubai. 
According to reports in local Russian media, Maria Kovalchuk’s relatives believe that she could have been made a sex slave and “raped for several days” before eventually being thrown onto the road.

Suspicion is that she attended a cult-like party with “unknown sheiks,” where models and OnlyFans stars, especially those from Eastern European countries like
Local Russian media outlets have reported that her relatives believe she could have been made a sex slave and “raped for several days” before eventually being thrown onto the road.

It is suspected by some that she attended a cult-like party with “unknown sheiks,” where models and OnlyFans stars, especially those from Eastern Europe, are known to be popular.

The event is believed to have been a “Porta Potty” party — a phrase used to describe gatherings with female influencers who are paid exorbitant amounts of money to carry out horrific and degrading sexual acts, sometimes involving feces.

The women, who can be paid around $100,000 to attend, are said to be subjected to extreme abuse to fulfill the dark desires of wealthy men.

Kovalchuk reportedly met with two men from the “modeling business” while in Dubai, and the next day, she told her family she was going to stay with them for the night.

A few days later, she was meant to fly to Thailand but did not make the flight and was not heard from again until she was found on the side of the road.

Her mother, Anna, flew from Norway to be with her daughter while she recovered from her horrific injuries.

Her family says she will make a full recovery. 

“She is getting medical treatment and everything will be all right,” her mother posted on social media.

“There is an assumption that she went to a party, but the promoter who organized these parties did not see her. 

“Maria was eventually found in hospital in serious condition. She has no documents, no phone, nothing. 

“She underwent three, now four, operations. And she cannot speak.”

Dubai police confirmed to the media that the “Ukrainian citizen previously reported missing is currently hospitalized, receiving medical care with her family present.”

They claim that the woman’s injuries occurred due to falling from a construction site. 

“A comprehensive investigation has revealed that she sustained serious injuries after entering a restricted construction site alone and falling from a height,” local police said.

However, Russian news outlet Shot reported that Kovalchuk’s family does not believe this to be the case.

Lawyer Katya Gordon has desperately urged influencers to avoid these types of events while in Dubai. 

“The model was found dying on the side of the road in the UAE after a party with Arab sheiks,” the lawyer said, as reported in the Sun.

“The scandal with the Porta Potty parties has been raging for over a year.
